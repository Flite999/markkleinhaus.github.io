Logical expressions evaluate to True (1) or False (0).

#### Logical Operators
* Negation $$\neg$$
    * $$\neg$$A is the OPPOSITE value of A.
* Conjunction $$\wedge$$
    * A$$\wedge$$B is true if both A AND B are true.
* Disjunction $$\vee$$
    * A$$\vee$$B is true if A OR B OR both are true.
* Implication $$\rightarrow$$
    * A$$\rightarrow$$B is true if whenever A is true, B is true.
    * for example, if A is true (1), and B is false (0), A$$\rightarrow$$B is false.
* Equivalence $$\leftrightarrow$$
    * A$$\leftrightarrow$$B is true if A AND B are BOTH true or BOTH false.

#### Predicate
An expression that is true or false depending on parameters. Usually denoted with a capital letters, ex: P(x)

#### Quantifier
Connects a logical expression to the elements of a set
* $$\forall$$ for all
* $$\exists$$ exists/there is
* Ex: $$\forall$$x($$\exists$$y(y < x ))
    * For each element x in the set, there is an element y in the set, such that y < x
